# myDevsA-Book

The basic phone address books are great and easy to use. However, as a Developer who loves the community. I want to be able to have a robust, well-detailed, organized and personalizable address book for all devs I know. In this repo, I have created a deveopers addressbook that creates a robust profile for all kinds of devs, creatives, and stakeholders in Tech.
